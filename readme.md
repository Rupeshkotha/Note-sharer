# Note Sharer - A Temporary Text Sharing App

A simple web application built with Flask and Bootstrap that allows users to create and share text-based notes via a unique, private link. This project was built to demonstrate a full-stack application structure, including a Python backend, a responsive frontend, and client-side validation.

---

## Features

* **Create Notes**: Users can paste any amount of text into a form to create a new note.
* **Unique Links**: Each note is saved with a unique, randomly generated 6-character ID, making the links private and shareable.
* **Preserved Formatting**: The application preserves all original formatting of the text, including line breaks and spacing.
* **Client-Side Validation**: The form will not submit if the text area is empty, thanks to validation with jQuery.

## Technologies Used

* **Backend**: Python, Flask
* **Frontend**: HTML, Bootstrap 5, jQuery
* **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
